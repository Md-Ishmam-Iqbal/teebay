# Sazim take home challenege documentation

As the description of the challenge points out aptly that there are 3 parts to implement: Front end (fe), Back end (be) and Database (db).

The first thing I decided to tackle is the be and db. Why? Because getting these done would make things many times easier to handle in the fe.
