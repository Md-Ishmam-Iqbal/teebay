# Sazim take home challenege documentation

As the description of the challenge points out aptly that there are 3 parts to implement: Front end (fe), Back end (be) and Database (db).

The first thing I decided to tackle is the be and db. Why? Because getting these done would make things many times easier to handle in the fe.

Since be and db is very unfamiliar to me, I expected this to be the most challenging part of this project.

After setting up the server, db and prisma. With a basic user model, its time to attempt part 1: the login and user registration (sign up). Challenging parts of this section is to figure out how to communicate back and forth with the front end to simulate authentication.

## Completed functionality for Part 1

This was very challenging for me as the syntax of express and prisma was not very familiar to me.
Mantine initially felt a bit slow due to syntax unfamiliarity but it feels easy to work with.
Experience some weird errors with cors which was resolved by enabling the CORS policy in my express server.

## Start Part 2
